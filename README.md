> My work is a game, a very serious game

— M.C. Escher

I am a senior knowledge worker and independent consultant specializing in Software Product Engineering with 28 years of professional experience, coding since the age of eight and dreaming of computers since I am five.

I [learn extensively and continuously](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/Learn+extensively+and+continuously) because problem and solution spaces constantly evolve and cross into new knowledge domains and [learning is the bottleneck](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/Learning+is+the+bottleneck).

Working primarily with small businesses, I'm well-versed in the entire Software Development Life Cycle from Information Architecture and UX Design to Software Architecture, Data Architecture, Software Engineering, DevOps Engineering, and Service Reliability Engineering.

In 2023, I begin broadening my focus to include Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

Over the past decade, I learn how to build systems that build systems by designing, integrating, deploying, documenting, and advocating for best practices and technology stacks. I also dedicate time to teaching and mentoring my teammates. Along the way, I learn to [leverage technical debt](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/Leverage+technical+debt).

I am proficient in designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and operating containerized web applications. My everyday toolbox contains Angular for single-page apps, Nest.js for web services, SQL and NoSQL databases, and GitLab CI/CD pipelines for deploying applications to Docker Swarm clusters provisioned using Ansible and monitored using OpenTelemetry.

[As a Product Engineer, I am a stakeholder](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/As+a+product+engineer%2C+I+am+a+stakeholder). As a knowledge worker, I value autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Money isn't a purpose; money is a measure.

[Collaboration and cooperation aren't the same thing](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/Collaboration+and+cooperation+aren't+the+same+thing). I favor cooperation because I don’t want to cover for others’ mistakes when they don’t invest in continuous learning. While this might make me seem less well-rounded, the opportunity cost of compensating for others is too high. I've been on the other side.

[I am the Farmer in the Covey Matrix](https://notes.adrianodigiovanni.com/I+am+the+Farmer+in+the+Covey+Matrix). Small businesses hire me to cultivate best practices, plant well-adapted technology stacks, nurture PoCs and MVPs, and help grow teams through teaching and mentoring, because [Software is a medium for storing executable knowledge](https://adrianodigiovanni.com/software-is-a-medium-for-storing-executable-knowledge/) and [small businesses need deep generalists](https://adrianodigiovanni.com/small-businesses-need-deep-generalists/).
